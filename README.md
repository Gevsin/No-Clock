You'll have to set the "api-key" attribute in the header.<br/>
Finaly, you'll have to set the body like this:
```json
{
    "icon": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 1,
        "value": "hourglass"
    },
    "message": {
        "x": 11,
        "y": 1,
        "value": "8 minutesand 23   seconds  remaining"
    },
